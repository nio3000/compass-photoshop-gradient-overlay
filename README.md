A compass extension to translate between Photoshop gradient overlays and CSS linear-gradients. Allows you to take values directly from the layer style and create an identical gradient in pure CSS.

Blend mode translation is also included with this Compass extension.

This code is bundled as a Compass extension, but is also compatible with Boubon.

# Compass Extension Installation

## Install the Ruby Gem.

  ```
  gem install compass-photoshop-gradient-overlay
  ```

### Install into an existing project:

Edit the project configuration file (`config.rb`) and add:

  ```ruby
  require 'compass-photoshop-gradient-overlay'
  ```

Then run this command from the root of your project:

  ```
  compass install compass-photoshop-gradient-overlay
  ```

### When creating a new project:

  ```
  compass create my_project -r compass-photoshop-gradient-overlay --using compass-photoshop-gradient-overlay
  ```

By default, the extension doesn't add any files to your project. An example scss and html file can be imported by installing the "example" pattern:

  ```
  compass install compass-photoshop-gradient-overlay/example
  ```

# Usage

  ```scss
  @import 'photoshop-gradient-overlay';
  ```

## Function Reference

  ```scss
  photoshop-gradent-overlay( $bg-color, [$blend], [$opacity], [$angle], [$scale], [$color-stops] )
  ```

### Function Parameters

`$bg-color` (required, Color) The background color of the element.

`$blend` (optional, String) The blend mode used to mix the gradient and the background-color. Defaults to "normal" (no blending).

`$opacity` (optional, Percentage) The strength of the overlay. Accepts values between 0% & 100%. Defaults to 100%.

`$angle` (optional, Angle) The direction of the overlay. Accepts values between 0deg & 359deg. Defaults to 90deg (bottom to top).

`$scale` (optional, Percentage) The size of the overlay. Defaults to 100%.

`$color-stops` (optional, List) A list of stop color & locations in the gradient. Defaults to (#000 0%, #fff 100%).

### Code Samples

Simple gradient using default parameters:

  ```scss
  .simple-gradient {
    @include background-image( photoshop-gradient-overlay(white) );
  }
  ```

  ```css
  .simple-gradient {
    background-image: linear-gradient(0deg, #000000 0%, #ffffff 100%);
    …
  }
  ```

Complex gradient:

  ```scss
  .complex-gradient {
    @include background-image(
      photoshop-gradient-overlay( #fff, normal, 75%, 0deg, 50%, ( red 0%, orange 20%, yellow 40%, green 60%, blue 80%, violet 100% ) )
    );
  }
```

  ```css
  .complex-gradient {
    background-image: linear-gradient(-90deg, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.75) 25%, rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.75) 35%, rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.75) 45%, rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.75) 55.0%, rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.75) 65%, rgba(238, 130, 238, 0.75) 75%);
    …
  }
  ```
